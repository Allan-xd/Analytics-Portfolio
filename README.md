ðŸ“˜ Titanic Survival Prediction â€“ Week 1 Mini Project

ðŸ”¹ Project Overview

This is my first mini project as part of my MSc in Business Analytics at University College Dublin (UCD).
The project focuses on the Titanic dataset, a classic dataset used in machine learning to predict survival outcomes of passengers.

The goal was to:

  1. Explore and clean the dataset

  2. Understand key features that affect survival

  3. Build an initial predictive model using Python




ðŸ”¹ Tools & Technologies

    1. Python (Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Scikit-learn)

    2. Jupyter Notebook (via Anaconda)

    3. GitHub for version control & sharing



ðŸ”¹ Steps Covered

    1. Data Import & Exploration

        Loaded dataset (train.csv) into Pandas DataFrame

        Checked missing values, data types, and overall structure

    2. Data Cleaning

        Handled missing values (Age, Cabin, Embarked)

        Converted categorical variables to numeric (e.g., Gender)

    3. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

        Survival rate by gender, class, and age groups

        Visualizations (bar charts, histograms)

    4. Feature Engineering

        Created new features such as FamilySize

    5. Model Building (Intro)

        Applied Logistic Regression to predict survival

        Evaluated basic accuracy score

    6. Insights

        Females had higher survival chances

        Higher-class passengers (1st Class) were more likely to survive

        Age influenced survival moderately




ðŸ”¹ Results

    Achieved a baseline accuracy of ~77% with Logistic Regression

    Learned the importance of feature selection & data cleaning


ðŸ”¹ Future Improvements

    Try advanced models (Random Forest, XGBoost)

    Perform hyperparameter tuning

    Deploy a simple web app with the model
